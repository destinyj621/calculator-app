# iPhone App Replica in Unity

This project is a functional replica of an iPhone app, created using Unity with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The app aims to replicate iOS interface and user experience features, built with Unity's cross-platform compatibility and C# scripting.

## Features

* **MVC Architecture**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the app more modular, maintainable, and testable.
* **UI Replication**: Mimics iOS design elements to provide a seamless user experience similar to an iPhone app.

## Project Structure

* **Models**: Contains data models that represent the core logic and business data.
* **Views**: Holds all UI elements, ensuring they are strictly used to render the interface.
* **Controllers**: Handles user input and facilitates the interaction between Models and Views.
